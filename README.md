## Description
A web application that displays data on tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic basin since 1851, fetched from the [Atlantic Hurricane Database](https://github.com/mikematics22800/Atlantic-Hurricane-Database) I created. An interactive map displays detailed track information for every tropical cyclone recorded each year, along with charts which display various statistics for each storm individually and the year cumulatively.
